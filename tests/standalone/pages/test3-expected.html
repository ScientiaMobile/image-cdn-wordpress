it&#8217;s taking to ensure that its vaccine remains effective in the face of emerging strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that leads to COVID-19. These include testing how adding a second booster, for a total of three shots, works with its existing COVID-19 vaccine, and also developing a strain-specific variant designed to target spike proteins on the new variants of the virus that were first identified in the U.K. and in South Africa.<\/p>\n<p>The company is pursuing these measures &#8220;out of an abundance of caution,&#8221; the biotech firm said in <a href=\"https:\/\/investors.modernatx.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-retains-neutralizing-activity-against\">a press release<\/a>, since early studies show that the existing vaccine continues to prove effective against these new strains, albeit with some loss of efficacy specifically with the B.1.351 variant, which was first identified in patients in South Africa. Even so, it&#8217;s heartening to see the company moving quickly to address the virus&#8217; mutation, since it&#8217;s likely that similar adaptations will be required longer term to keep COVID-19 in control even once the current pandemic is ended.<\/p>\n<p>Further, Moderna says that in fact, it expects both its forthcoming candidate and its existing booster vaccine should be able to provide additional immunity-boosting capabilities when used in combination with &#8220;all of the leading vaccine candidates&#8221; on the market. That means the company believes it could be used in combination with the Oxford or Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccines to boost immunity, which could be helpful in cases where supplies of one or the other are low and there&#8217;s an urgent need to provide a booster in a timely manner.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The best news of all of this is, of course, that Moderna now has evidence that suggests the mRNA-based vaccine it&#8217;s already providing to people globally will still provide protection against SARS-CoV-2, and by extension, COVID-19. Specifically for the U.K. variant in particular, the study data shows no reduction in immune performance in patients who received the vaccine. As for the South African variant, that reduction in efficacy mostly translates to a potential of quicker waning of immunity provided by the jab &#8212; which hopefully just means people will need another jab sooner than expected, but shouldn&#8217;t lead to any dramatic changes in our combined global approach to providing inoculations, especially initially.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"yobzbqblBH\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/11\/moderna-is-developing-three-new-mrna-based-vaccines-for-seasonal-flu-hiv-and-nipah-virus\/\">Moderna is developing three new mRNA-based vaccines for seasonal flu, HIV and Nipah virus<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Moderna is developing three new mRNA-based vaccines for seasonal flu, HIV and Nipah virus&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/11\/moderna-is-developing-three-new-mrna-based-vaccines-for-seasonal-flu-hiv-and-nipah-virus\/embed\/#?secret=yobzbqblBH\" data-secret=\"yobzbqblBH\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Moderna has detailed some of the steps it&#8217;s taking to ensure that its vaccine remains effective in the face of emerging strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that leads to COVID-19.

and SPAC raconteur Chamath Palihapitiya <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/chamath\/status\/1353674959789256705\">announced two new<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/chamath\/status\/1353673101901369345\">blank-check deals<\/a> involving Latch and Sunlight Financial.<\/p>\n<p>Latch, an enterprise SaaS company that makes keyless-entry systems, has raised $152 million in private capital, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/latch\/company_financials\">according to Crunchbase<\/a>. Sunlight Financial, which offers point-of-sale financing for residential solar systems, has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/sunlight-financial\/company_financials\">raised north of $700 million<\/a> in venture capital, private equity and debt.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re going to chat about the two transactions.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no escaping SPACs for a bit, so if you are tired of watching blind pools rip private companies into the public markets, you are not going to have a very good next few months. Why? There are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/when-spacs-attack-a-new-force-is-invading-wall-street-11611378007?mod=djemalertNEWS\">nearly 300 SPACs<\/a> in the market today looking for deals, and many will find one.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/subscribe\/?tpcc=theexchange\">every morning on Extra Crunch<\/a>, or get <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/newsletters\">The Exchange newsletter<\/a> every Saturday.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Think of SPACs are increasingly hungry sharks. As a shark get hungrier while the clock winds down on its deal-making window, it may get less choosy about what it eats (take public). There are enough SPACs on the hunt today that they would be noisy even if they were not time-constrained investment vehicles. But as their timers tick, expect their deal-making to get all the more creative.<\/p>\n<p>This brings us back to Chamath&#8217;s two deals. Are they more like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/12\/2021-a-spac-odyssey\/\">the Bakkt SPAC<\/a>, which led us to raise a few questions? Or more akin to the Talkspace SPAC, which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/23\/how-vcs-and-founders-see-2021-differently\/\">we found pretty reasonable?<\/a>\u00a0Let&#8217;s find out.<\/p>\n<h2>Keyless locks = Peloton for real estate<\/h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with the Latch deal.<\/p>\n<p>New York-based Latch sells &#8220;LatchOS,&#8221; a hardware and software system that works in buildings where access and amenities matter. Latch&#8217;s hardware works with doors, sensors and internet connectivity.<\/p>\n<p>The company has raised a number of private rounds, including a $126 million deal in August of 2019 that valued the company at $454.3 million on a post-money basis, <a href=\"http:\/\/pitchbook.com\">according to PitchBook<\/a> data. The company raised another $30 million in October of 2020, though its final private valuation is not known.<\/p>\n<p>As Chamath tweeted this morning, Latch is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.latch.com\/news\/latch-announces-planned-merger-with-tishman-speyer-sponsored-spac\">merging with TS Innovation Acquisitions Corp<\/a>, or $TSIA. The SPAC is associated with Tishman Speyer, a commercial real estate investor. You can see the synergies, as Latch&#8217;s products fit into the commercial real estate space.<\/p>\n<p>Up front, Latch is not a company that is only reporting future revenues.

Its booked software revenues grew 37.1%, while its booked hardware top line expanded over 70% during the same period.<\/p>\n<p>That could be due to strong hardware installation fees, which could later result in software revenues; the company claims an average of a six-year software deal, so hardware revenues that are attached to new software incomes could low key declaim long-term SaaS revenues.<\/p>\n<p><em>Update: Adding some clarity here, the above are &#8220;booked&#8221; revenues, which I&#8217;ve made more clear, not actual revenues. Its net revenues, better known as actual revenues, were $18 million, with $14 million of that coming from hardware. So, today, the company is certainly more hardware-heavy than I first thought. Damn non-S-1 filings!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>While <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/loganbartlett\/status\/1353684437775638529\">some were quick to note<\/a> that the company is far from pure-SaaS &#8212; correct &#8212; I suspect that the model that could get some traction amongst investors is that this feels a bit like Peloton for real estate. How so? Peloton has large hardware incomes up front from new users, which convert to long-term subscription revenues. Latch may prove similar, albeit for a different customer base and market.<\/p>\n<p>Per the deal&#8217;s reported terms, Latch will be worth $1.56 billion after the transaction.

raises $110M on a $1.3B valuation to bring B2B payments for SMBs into the 21st century"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Payments for consumers have made a huge shift to the online world in the last year, a time when they have moved more of their purchasing to the internet to minimize in-person transactions in the midst of a virus-based health pandemic. Today, a startup that has built a similar kind of payments infrastructure &#8212; but specifically targeting small businesses and the payments they need to make &#8212; has raised a big round of funding to double down on its own slice of the market.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.meliopayments.com\/\">Melio<\/a>, which provides a platform for SMBs to pay other companies electronically using bank transfers, debit cards or credit &#8212; along with the option of cutting paper checks for recipients if that is what the recipients request &#8212; has closed $110 million in funding at a valuation that the company said was now $1.3 billion.<\/p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s focus to date has been building and growing a system to replace the paper invoices, snail mail and bank transfers that might take multiple days to clear and still dominate payments for small and medium enterprises. The company was founded in Israel but has to date focused a lot of its attention on the U.S. market, where it saw growth of 2,000% last year (it doesn&#8217;t disclose the actual number of customers that it has). CEO Matan Bar said that this is where the company will continue to focus for now.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>This latest round was led by Coatue and also included participation from previous backers Accel, Aleph, Bessemer Venture Partners, Corner Ventures, General Catalyst and Latitude. It caps off a huge year for the company, which raised $130 million in 2020 (and $256 million overall), with other recent backers including others like American Express and Salesforce.<\/p>\n<p>The latter two are strategic backers: AmEx is one of the options given to customers paying other businesses through Melio&#8217;s rails.<\/p>\n<p>Salesforce, meanwhile, is not yet an integration partner, but Bar &#8212; who co-founded the company with Ilan Atias and Ziv Paz (respectively CTO and COO) &#8212; described its interest as similar to that of Intuit-owned accounting giant QuickBooks. QuickBooks connects with Melio so that users of one can seamlessly import activity from one platform into the other, and Bar hinted that there is an interest from the CRM giant, which provides a number of other business and productivity tools, to work together in a similar fashion.<\/p>\n<p>Bar came to found Melio on the heels of years of experience in peer-to-peer payments focused on the consumer market. He previously ran PayPal&#8217;s business unit focused on peer-to-peer payments, which included Venmo in the U.S. and equivalent services (not branded Venmo) outside of it. He came to PayPal, which at the time was a part of eBay, through eBay&#8217;s acquisition of his previous startup, a social gifting platform called <a href=\"https:\/\/en.globes.co.il\/en\/article-1000681080\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Gifts Project<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As Bar describes it, PayPal &#8220;was the first time I experienced what the digitization of payments looked like as they were shifting from cash to mobile payments. Consumers were buying online instead of at brick-and-mortar stores, and even when they were getting physical items, they were paying online.&#8221; What he quickly realized, though, was that the same was not applying to the businesses themselves.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There are still trillions being transferred via paper checks in the B2B space,&#8221; he said, with paper invoices and paper checks dominating the market. &#8220;The space is way behind other payment areas. I would be talking with SMB owners who would be using fancy Square or PayPal point of sale devices, but when they had to pay, say, a coffee bean supplier, they stuffed checks in envelopes. That\u2019s very intriguing obviously, and it triggered our interest.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Interestingly this isn&#8217;t a problem that hasn&#8217;t been identified before, but many of the solutions, such as Bill.com or <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/06\/tipalti-receives-150m-at-a-2b-valuation-after-its-accounts-payable-platform-sees-a-surge-in-use\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tipalti<\/a>, are really designed for larger enterprises. &#8220;They are too overwhelming for SMBs,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Even their names say it all:\u00a0Accounts Payable Automation Solutions. It\u2019s about tens of thousands of payments, and accounting departments, not an order from a wine shop.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"1DPpdFuxIQ\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/06\/tipalti-receives-150m-at-a-2b-valuation-after-its-accounts-payable-platform-sees-a-surge-in-use\/\">Tipalti receives $150M at a $2B+ valuation after its accounts payable platform sees a surge in use<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Tipalti receives $150M at a $2B+ valuation after its accounts payable platform sees a surge in use&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/06\/tipalti-receives-150m-at-a-2b-valuation-after-its-accounts-payable-platform-sees-a-surge-in-use\/embed\/#?secret=1DPpdFuxIQ\" data-secret=\"1DPpdFuxIQ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>That formed the basis of what the startup started to build, which has been, in essence, a very pared-down version of these other payments platforms with SMB needs in mind.<\/p>\n<p>The first of these is a focus on cashflow, Bar said. Specifically, the Melio platform lets payments be made automatically but businesses themselves can delay the timing on when money actually leaves their accounts: &#8220;Buyers keep cash longer, vendors get paid faster,&#8221; is how Bar describes it.<\/p>\n<p>This is in part enabled by the tech that Melio has built, which builds in risk assessment, as well as fraud management, and balances payments across the whole of its platform to send money in and out without the need for the company to raise debt to back up those payments.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We leverage data to assess risk,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;Every dollar in this round is going towards R&amp;D and sales and marketing. We don\u2019t need the capital in our model.&#8221; It also works with the likes of AmEx and its own credit system in cases where people are paying on credit, but Bar also noted that currently most of the transactions that happen on its platform are not credit based. Most are bank transfers.<\/p>\n<p>While others like Stripe have also built B2B payment services to pay out suppliers, Bar points out that what it has created is unique in that it is a standalone service: no need to be a part of Stripe&#8217;s wider ecosystem of services to use this if you already use another payments provider you are happy with.<\/p>\n<p>Given that focus on cashflow for SMBs, what&#8217;s also interesting is the low bar to entry that Melio has built into its platform. Specifically, the service is completely free for businesses to use &#8212; that is, no fee is charged &#8212; as long as companies are making bank transfers or using debit cards. It takes a 2.9% fee when a business elects to use a credit card for a transaction (and even then Melio says that the fee is tax deductible in the U.S.).<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">He noted that one of the reasons that Melio has to date targeted the U.S. market is because of how antiquated it still is. &#8220;The average bank transfer still takes three to four business days, if you don\u2019t want to take any risk,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have developed models to do it same day. We take the risk that the buyer might not have the funds in that account but think about how that impacts cash flows. With Melio you still pay in three days, but money will be delivered the same day. That is how you can keep cash longer, without a payments risk.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Targeting a market that remains very underserved at a time when so much has gone virtual in payments is why investors are also interested.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMelio has identified both the opportunity and duty to help small businesses manage their finance remotely and improve cash flow, in normal times as well as during this crisis, as physical payments supply chains are interrupted and overwhelmed,&#8221; said\u00a0Michael Gilroy, a general partner at Coatue, in a statement. &#8220;Going digital is the only way small businesses can compete against larger rivals and stay ahead of the curve.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">In terms of more product development, Bar said that the company has\u00a0<\/span>received &#8220;a lot of incoming interest from partners to enable B2B payments within their products on their product,&#8221; similar to what QuickBooks is doing and Salesforce is likely to do. &#8220;Payments are contextual and they want to enable a quicker way to get there. The SMB is underserved. And yes, from a unit economics it\u2019s much better to go after Nike. But this is also to really create some financial inclusion. We want to enable services for the small shop that the big guys already have.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"DdbGOa6XZ5\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/21\/all-b2b-startups-are-in-the-payments-business\/\">All B2B startups are in the payments business<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;All B2B startups are in the payments business&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/21\/all-b2b-startups-are-in-the-payments-business\/embed\/#?secret=DdbGOa6XZ5\" data-secret=\"DdbGOa6XZ5\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Payments for consumers have made a huge shift to the online world in the last year, a time when they have moved more of their purchasing to the internet to minimize in-person transactions in the midst of a virus-based health pandemic.

ordering and delivery company that initially focused on restaurants but has since expanded to other verticals, has raised $530 million in new funding. The round was led by Iconiq Growth, with participation from Tiger Global, DST, KKR, Prosus, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/17\/carolina-brochado-eqt-growth\/\">EQT Growth<\/a> and Coatue.<\/p>\n<p>Previous backers 83North, Highland Europe, Goldman Sachs Growth Equity, EQT Ventures and Vintage Investment Partners also followed on. The new round takes the total amount of financing Wolt has raised to $856 million. Wolt declined to disclose the company&#8217;s latest valuation, although we know from the previous D round that the company is one of Europe&#8217;s so-called unicorns.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe operate in an extremely competitive and well-funded industry, and this round allows us to have a long-term mindset when it comes to doubling down on our different markets,\u201d says co-founder and CEO Miki Kuusi in a statement. \u201cDespite the turbulence of 2020, we\u2019ve remained focused on growth, tripling our revenue to a preliminary $330 million against a net loss of just $38 million. Compared to the $670 million in new capital that we\u2019ve raised during this year, this puts us into a strong position for investing in our people, technology, and markets when thinking about the next few years ahead\u201d.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"eY9pf7rbSw\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/17\/carolina-brochado-eqt-growth\/\">Former Atomico and SoftBank VC Carolina Brochado has joined EQT to help build its new growth fund<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Former Atomico and SoftBank VC Carolina Brochado has joined EQT to help build its new growth fund&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/17\/carolina-brochado-eqt-growth\/embed\/#?secret=eY9pf7rbSw\" data-secret=\"eY9pf7rbSw\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Since launching with 10 restaurants in its home city in 2015, five years on Wolt has expanded to 23 countries and 120 cities, mostly in Europe but also including Japan and Israel. More recently, like others in the restaurant delivery space, Wolt has expanded beyond restaurants and takeout food into the grocery and retail sectors. This, says the company, sees it offer anything from cosmetics to pet food and pharmaceuticals on its platform.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis was mostly a primary raise,\u201d Kuusi tells me when I ask if the new round includes secondary funding (i.e. shareholders that exited to new investors). \u201cWe&#8217;re not looking to disclose the valuation at this time, but we&#8217;ve previously shared that the Series D round that we raised in early 2020 valued the company at above \u20ac1 billion,\u201d he adds.<\/p>\n<p>Kuusi says that the latest funding round is based on the belief that local services in the offline world will gradually be brought online by players \u201cthat can execute and maintain a great customer experience\u201d. \u201cWe started with an exclusive focus on the restaurant, as it&#8217;s the biggest local service with an underlying high-frequency use case,\u201d he says. \u201cWe quickly learnt that the magical product market fit for bringing the restaurant online was to offer a quick and predictable delivery experience from restaurants that didn&#8217;t use to be available for delivery. We do this by handling the complexity of the delivery on the restaurant&#8217;s behalf\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>However, this was especially difficult to do efficiently and sustainably in a small and difficult home market in the Nordics. To solve this, Wolt needed to build an \u201coptimization-heavy logistics setup for last-mile delivery\u201d that Kuusi says lets the service operate even in \u201cvery small cities with low income disparity, limited population density and high labor costs\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis means that we can operate efficiently even with relatively low order volumes, enabling us to grow and expand rapidly with much less financing than some of the other players in the market. We simply had no other choice than to do it this way as we came from such a difficult home market\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>On this foundation, Wolt is expanding into other ordering and local delivery verticals, aiming to be what Kuusi dubs as \u201cthe everything app\u201d of goods and services. \u201cToday, Wolt is much more than a restaurant delivery service; you can order groceries, electronics, flowers, clothes and many other things on our platform,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe believe that the future of how people buy Nike shoes is a few taps on Wolt and some 30 minutes later you get any pair of shoes brought to your door. This is what we strive to make into a reality with our team at Wolt\u201d. (I\u2019m an Adidas guy myself, steadfastly European.)<\/p>\n<p>Asked what he thinks about all the money being pumped into the dark convenience store model, Kuusi says Wolt is investing into its own dark store operation called Wolt Market. \u201cIt&#8217;s not surprising to also see a growing amount of financing going into this sector&#8221;, he admits. &#8220;We&#8217;re huge believers in a hybrid model where there will be both offline\/online retailers as well as focused online retailers in the mix.

teach their kids financial literacy, announced the raise of a $3.9 million seed round this morning, led by Astia.<\/p>\n<p>PNC Bank, Mastercard, U.S. Bank, Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures, Elevate Capital, Portfolia&#8217;s First Step and Rising America Fund and Pipeline Angels also participated in the round. The round also saw participation from a handful of individual investors including Robert F. Smith, Kevin Durant, Chris Paul, Baron Davis, Sterling K. Brown, Ryan Bathe, CC Sabathia and Amber Sabathia.<\/p>\n<p>Goalsetter <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/12\/goalsetter-gives-parents-a-way-to-teach-their-kids-how-to-save-money\/\">launched in 2019<\/a> out of the Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator. Founded by Tanya Van Court, who lost over $1 million in the 2001 bubble burst, the platform teaches financial literacy to children of all ages, helping them learn economic concepts, lingo and the principles of financial health.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>After long stints at Nickelodeon and ESPN, Van Court understands deeply how kids learn and what keeps their attention. She vowed to make sure that her children were never ignorant of what it takes to protect their wealth and create more.<\/p>\n<p>The app also allows parents to give allowances through the app, and even pay out their own specified amount for every quiz question the kid gets right in the app. Plus, family and friends can give &#8220;goal cards&#8221; instead of gift cards, helping kids save for the things they really want in the future.<\/p>\n<p>The company recently launched a debit card for kids, as well, letting parents control the way the card is used and even lock it until their kids have passed the week&#8217;s financial literacy quiz.<\/p>\n<p>Families save an average of $120 a month on the platform, and Van Court says that two families saved over $10,000 in the last year.<\/p>\n<p>The company is also launching a massive campaign next week for Black History Month with the goal of closing the wealth gap among Black children and kids of color\u00a0through financial education.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one thing to put a debit card into your teenager&#8217;s hands,&#8221; said Van Court. &#8220;That&#8217;s great. That teaches them how to spend money. It&#8217;s another thing to teach kids the core concepts about how to build wealth, or to know the difference between putting your money into an investment account, or putting your money into a CD versus a mutual fund versus a savings account. We teach what interest rates are, and what compound interest means. Our focus is on financial education because it&#8217;s not enough to teach kids how to spend.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Goalsetter raised $2.1 million in 2019 and now adds this latest round to that for a total of $6 million raised. This latest round was oversubscribed, giving Van Court the opportunity to be super selective about her investors.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Every single one of these investors has a demonstrated commitment prior to people marching in the streets in April, to social justice and to investing in diversity and inclusion initiatives and people,&#8221; said Van Court. &#8220;Every single one of them. That was really important because we were oversubscribed and we had the luxury of being able to pick who our investors were. Every one of the investors that we invited to our table were investors who we knew invited folks who look like us in 2019 and 2018 and 2017 to their table.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Nw2OUY4AH5\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/12\/goalsetter-gives-parents-a-way-to-teach-their-kids-how-to-save-money\/\">Goalsetter gives parents a way to teach their kids how to save money<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Goalsetter gives parents a way to teach their kids how to save money&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/12\/goalsetter-gives-parents-a-way-to-teach-their-kids-how-to-save-money\/embed\/#?secret=Nw2OUY4AH5\" data-secret=\"Nw2OUY4AH5\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Goalsetter, a platform that helps parents teach their kids financial literacy, announced the raise of a $3.9 million seed round this morning, led by Astia.

We believed then, as we do now, that fintech represents one of the most exciting major innovation cycles of this decade. In 2020, all the long-term trends forcing change in this sector continued and even accelerated.<\/p>\n<p>The broad movement away from credit toward debit, particularly among younger consumers, represents one such macro shift. However, the pandemic also created new, unforeseen drivers. Among them, millennials decamped from their rentals in crowded cities to accelerate their first home purchase, to the benefit of proptech companies and challenger mortgage players alike.<\/p>\n<p>E-commerce saw an enormous acceleration in growth rates, furthering adoption of online payments platforms. Lastly, low interest rates and looming inflation helped pave the way for the price of Bitcoin to charge toward $30,000. In short, multiple tailwinds combined to produce a blockbuster year for the category.<\/p>\n<p>In this year\u2019s refresh of the Matrix Fintech Index, we\u2019ll divide our attention into three parts. First, a look at the public stocks\u2019 performance. Second, liquidity. Third, we highlight one major trend in the sector: Buy Now Pay Later, or BNPL.<\/p>\n<h2>Public\u00a0fintech\u00a0stocks rose 97% in 2020<\/h2>\n<p>For the fourth straight year, the publicly traded fintechs massively outperformed the incumbent financial services providers as well as every mainstream stock index. While the underlying performance of these companies was strong, the pandemic further bolstered results as consumers avoided appearing in-person for both shopping and banking. Instead, they sought &#8212; and found &#8212; digital alternatives.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tFor the fourth straight year, the publicly traded fintechs massively outperformed the incumbent financial services providers as well as every mainstream stock index.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>Our own representation of the public fintechs\u2019 performance is the Matrix Fintech Index &#8212; a market cap-weighted index that tracks the progress of a portfolio of 25 leading public fintech companies.

As far as the age of COVID-19 is concerned, that\u2019s probably more bug than feature. It\u2019s a way to escape the confines of a shutdown for a few glorious moments, to get some air and, for better or worse, reflect on the day that\u2019s passed or the one to come.<\/p>\n<p>It can, like many things these days, however, be isolating.<\/p>\n<p>For me, long weekend walks have been a sort of lifesaver throughout this bizarre year. Following two months of being completely sidelined over (non-COVID) health issues, I began walking more per week than I ever have. It was a slow process at first &#8212; frankly, never leaving my one-bedroom apartment for April and May made it so it was physically painful to walk around the block when I finally felt comfortable going outside.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>These days, I walk every morning, regularly crossing the bridge into Brooklyn and Manhattan. Until I started using Apple\u2019s new Fitness+ service a few times a day, it was easily my main source of exercise. In November, however, my Apple Watch Activity bars swapped the more generic gray for the Fitness+ yellow. But even as I\u2019ve made a point to do a couple of indoor exercises a day, I still start each day with a walk. Rain, snow, this weekend\u2019s sub-freezing weather &#8212; skipping a day would feel like breaking a promise to myself.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2100227\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2100227\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2100227\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/IMG_6696.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"496\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/IMG_6696.jpg 1170w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/IMG_6696.jpg?resize=150,73 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/IMG_6696.jpg?resize=300,145 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/IMG_6696.jpg?resize=768,372 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/IMG_6696.jpg?resize=680,330 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/IMG_6696.jpg?resize=50,24 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2100227\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">My actual bars (not sure what happened in September &#8212; maybe testing a competitor&#8217;s device)<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>This morning Apple dropped the first five installments (episodes?) of Time to Walk. The feature is an attempt to expand the Fitness+ experience beyond the confines of its titular iOS app. A largely Watch-based experience, the feature leverages much of the wearable\u2019s existing features (and Apple\u2019s growing software ecosystem) to offer a more tailored and multimedia experience than you would get listening to a podcast or music alone.<\/p>\n<p>As with the canny arrival of Fitness+ (December) and handwashing for watchOS (September), Apple says the timing was something of a happy coincidence. The company had been working on the feature well before COVID-19 entered the picture.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEverything from Time to Walk and our launch of Fitness+ was something we had been working on well before COVID,\u201d the company\u2019s senior director of Fitness Technologies Jay Blahnik tells TechCrunch. \u201cFrom the very beginning, we thought of Fitness+ as a place where everyone was welcome. We wanted it to feel like a place where, whether you\u2019re new to fitness or very fit, there was something for everyone.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For many, a walk (or push, in the case of those who use a wheelchair for mobility) is square one when it comes to daily workouts. For my part, I was certainly far more comfortable taking quick strolls around the neighborhood. With limits on space and no real exercise equipment to speak of beyond a kettlebell and yoga mat, attempting to approximate the gym experience at home has seemed a fool\u2019s errand.<\/p>\n<p>April found me trying some YouTube yoga classes with limited efficacy. Like most attempts to exercise, it didn\u2019t stick. Walking every day was the only thing that did. And for the first time in my life, COVID-19 found me walking without any particular destination in mind. That old clich\u00e9 about it being about the journey not the destination is fine when you don\u2019t mind constantly being late to meetings. Walking for the sake of itself, however, changes the dynamic significantly. I speak to artists, writers and musicians on a regular basis for my podcast. The common sentiment is a familiar one: You simply can\u2019t force creativity. But for those who make a point to regularly walk and run, it\u2019s perhaps the most surefire way to kickstart the process.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"CVZr48bjXy\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/25\/apples-new-fitness-feature-brings-celebrity-guided-walks-to-your-wrist\/\">Apple\u2019s new Fitness+ feature brings celebrity-guided walks to your wrist<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Apple\u2019s new Fitness+ feature brings celebrity-guided walks to your wrist&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/25\/apples-new-fitness-feature-brings-celebrity-guided-walks-to-your-wrist\/embed\/#?secret=CVZr48bjXy\" data-secret=\"CVZr48bjXy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Time to Walk is Apple\u2019s attempt to capture some of that lightning in a bottle &#8212; to follow a rotating cast of big names as they walk through locations that mean something to them. The company says it\u2019s been making an effort to meet guests where they are and essentially coach them through the process. The ability to do so is, of course, depends on their given location &#8212; especially with all of the sorts of travel restrictions that have been in place since early last year.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, Apple says, the decisions of where to record are made by the guests. \u201cSome guests said, \u2018this is where I want to go,\u2019 \u201d says Blahnik. \u201cAnd some guests were like, \u2018no, I want to to do the walk I normally do.\u2019 For us, it\u2019s not about Shawn Mendes in the Grand Canyon, it\u2019s about where they want to go. Sometimes that\u2019s limited by COVID, but what we found delightful was for many people, they loved to take the walk they loved to take.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The first four guests &#8212; Mendes, Dolly Parton, Draymond Green and Uzo Aduba &#8212; run the gamut on approaches. \u201cWe think about the stories, we think about the diverse guest,\u201d says Blahnik. We think about all of the ways you\u2019d like the conversations to go. But what was important to us was that the idea resonated with them. The idea of going out for a walk, having a lovely conversation and hearing stories that could give you a different perspective.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Parton, who turned 75 earlier this month, recorded her session in a studio &#8212; in contrast to the other three names. She relates a handful of stories largely revolving around her upbringing in Sevier County (pronounced \u201csevere\u201d), Tennessee. There\u2019s a story about a Christmas tree and one about opening a literacy center with the help of her father (who struggled with his own ability to read and write).<\/p>\n<p>She somewhat self-effacingly relates a story about the time her hometown erected a statue of her. \u201cSo I went home, and I said, \u2018Daddy, did you know they&#8217;re putting a statue of me? Do you know about the statue down at the courthouse?\u2019 \u201d Parton explains. \u201cAnd Daddy said, \u2018Well, yeah, I heard about that.\u2019 He said, \u2018Now, to your fans out there, you might be some sort of an idol. But to them pigeons, you ain&#8217;t nothing but another outhouse.\u2019 \u201d<\/p>\n<p>According to Parton, her father would visit the statue at night with a bucket of soap and water to clean the pigeons\u2019 mess off his daughter\u2019s likeness. Her segment culminates with something approaching a behind the music-style segment, describing stories behind three of her own songs: \u201cCoat of Many Colors,\u201d \u201cCircle of Love\u201d and \u201c9 to 5.\u201d The latter is the real gem of the bunch, contrasting her morning routines to costars Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin, while describing the role her acrylic nails played in the songwriting and recording process.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2099965\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2099965\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2099965\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg 3000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=128,128 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2099965\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Apple<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Green\u2019s stories are more emblematic of the rest. On a walk around Malibu, the Warriors power forward discusses some inspiration stories on and off the court, from being told he would never be a star to a time he tried and failed to cheat on a test in school. The stories are purposefully personal. Aduba relates some of her own struggles to break into acting, as she walks her amusingly named dog Fenway Bark through Fort Green Park in Brooklyn.<\/p>\n<p>The guests share images relating to their stories or snapshots of where they go on their walks, which are delivered to the wrist with a haptic buzz. At they end of the journey, they share three handpicked songs that can be saved to a playlist on Apple Music, similar to what the company has done for its Fitness+ workouts.<\/p>\n<p>Write-ups of the Time to Walk have thus far compared it to podcasting &#8212; understandably so, given that it\u2019s an on-demand, audio-first experience. Though the feature, which downloads directly onto the Watch when the new installment drops once a week, has its own flavor, according to Apple.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOften podcasts are hosted,\u201d Blahnik says, by way of distinction. \u201cIn our journey to build out this experience, we certainly considered if there should be a host walking with this person. What we realized is that, for what we were trying to create, the intimacy of having the singular guest talk to you felt a lot more like you were on a walk with them. The notion that it\u2019s not happening in a studio (in almost all cases), that they\u2019re walking someplace that inspires them. You\u2019ll hear that with Draymond and Shawn &#8212; with Shawn he\u2019s huffing and puffing up that hill and it\u2019s kind of nice because you\u2019re in that moment together.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Time to Walk isn\u2019t raw, exactly. It is an Apple production, after all. The company\u2019s certainly not tossing out found audio here. But the content does seem more off-the-cuff than many of its productions, even as it\u2019s packaged together with a slick intro and a trio of songs at the end. But\u00a0it&#8217;s a nice change of pace for those looking for something that feels a little more personal than we\u2019re accustom to from some of the names involved.<\/p>\n<p>Your own mileage will vary, depending on, among other things, your interest in the guest. Though, there\u2019s always a chance someone you\u2019ve never been particularly interested in &#8212; or even heard of &#8212; will offer some unique tidbit or interesting way of looking at things. That\u2019s one of the potential upsides of having Apple doing the curating here &#8212; there\u2019s some interesting potential for discovery. And even in the case of artists you\u2019re familiar with, there\u2019s good potential to discover something new.<\/p>\n<p>The weekly 20 to 45-minute audio supplement won\u2019t make the actual act of walking any less solitary &#8212; but for a little while, at least, it\u2019s nice to feel like someone\u2019s along for the ride.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"PUTzynBdOT\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/14\/fitness-wont-replace-the-gym-but-it-will-help-you-break-a-sweat\/\">It won\u2019t replace the gym, but Fitness+ will help you break a sweat<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;It won\u2019t replace the gym, but Fitness+ will help you break a sweat&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/14\/fitness-wont-replace-the-gym-but-it-will-help-you-break-a-sweat\/embed\/#?secret=PUTzynBdOT\" data-secret=\"PUTzynBdOT\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A walk is, more often than not, a solitary experience.

1.3 million political and social issue ads, including those that ran between August 3 and November 3, 2020 \u2014 Election Day in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook&#8217;s Ad Library, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/28\/facebook-ads-library\/\">launched in 2019<\/a>, offers a searchable database of all ads running on Facebook and Instagram. Implemented after the 2016 Russian election interference fiasco, the database allows researchers and reporters to drill down into ads by topic, company and candidate, displaying data about when an ad ran, who saw it and how much it cost.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook says the decision to offer a deeper look into ads on the platform comes after feedback from the research community, which specifically requested more information about targeting. Facebook&#8217;s extremely granular ad targeting tools are of particular interest to researchers, who will soon have access to why certain people saw ads, including data on location and interest.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;We recognize that understanding the online political advertising landscape is key to protecting elections, and we know we can\u2019t do it alone,&#8221; Facebook Product Manager Sarah Clark Schiff wrote in the <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2021\/01\/increasing-transparency-around-us-2020-elections-ads\/\">announcement<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s ad targeting systems have plunged the company into hot water in the past. In 2016, Facebook disabled a targeting option for <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/11\/11\/facebook-sort-of-disables-ethnic-affinity-targeting\/\">&#8220;ethnic affinity&#8221; in credit, housing and employment-related ad categories<\/a> following reporting on how those tools could be abused for illegal discrimination. In 2018, the company <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/08\/21\/facebook-is-removing-over-5000-ad-targeting-options-to-prevent-discriminatory-ads\/\">removed 5,000 additional ad targeting options<\/a> due to similar potential for discriminatory advertising practices. And the extent to which the Trump campaign sailed into the White House on the strength of its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2020\/04\/how-facebooks-ad-technology-helps-trump-win\/606403\/\">micro-targeting Facebook ad operations<\/a> is still a matter of debate.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of how you feel about the tools themselves, Facebook&#8217;s public-facing ad library has been invaluable tool for reporters, providing both issue-specific deep dives and an easy at-a-glance view of political spending by party, race and candidate. The new targeting data won&#8217;t live on the public Ad Library but will instead be limited to the Facebook Open Research &amp; Transparency platform, which is only accessible by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/help\/contact\/337950863944028\">university-linked researchers<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"PCZn1pPaqe\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/08\/21\/facebook-is-removing-over-5000-ad-targeting-options-to-prevent-discriminatory-ads\/\">Facebook is removing over 5,000 ad targeting options to prevent discriminatory ads<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook is removing over 5,000 ad targeting options to prevent discriminatory ads&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/08\/21\/facebook-is-removing-over-5000-ad-targeting-options-to-prevent-discriminatory-ads\/embed\/#?secret=PCZn1pPaqe\" data-secret=\"PCZn1pPaqe\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Starting next month, Facebook will open up academic access to a dataset of 1.3 million political and social issue ads, including those that ran between August 3 and November 3, 2020 \u2014 Election Day in the U.S. Facebook&#8217;s Ad Library, launched in 2019, offers a searchable database of all ads running on Facebook and Instagram.

TechCrunch previously explored the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1747748\/000162828021000498\/qualtricss-1a2.htm\">company&#8217;s initial IPO filing<\/a> and its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/19\/a-first-look-at-qualtrics-ipo-pricing\/\">first IPO pricing interval<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>At the time, we described it as just that: Qualtrics&#8217; first IPO price range. We expected the company to raise its targets. Why? At its initial $22 to $26 per-share price range, it simply felt undervalued compared to current-market analogs and benchmarks.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about its new price range.<\/p>\n<h2>Pricing<\/h2>\n<p>Qualtrics is a SaaS company that is growing at a moderate clip and is nearly break-even if you remove the cost of share-based compensation. And at a run rate of around $800 million in its most recent quarter, it&#8217;s a large firm.<\/p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s not just another fast-growing SaaS firm that&#8217;s crested $100 million in ARR that is still running stiff deficits, it&#8217;s a different beast. That makes the effort to triangulate its valuation all the more fun.<\/p>\n<p>At its new interval and with some minor share-count tweaks detailed in its new filing, Qualtrics will raise as much as $1.68 billion in its debut, a figure that is exclusive of some transactions associated with the IPO.<\/p>\n<p>With its new $27 to $29 per-share IPO price range, Qualtrics is shooting a <em>little<\/em> bit higher than before.

The company said Birdwatch will use rank content based on algorithmic &#8220;reputation and consensus systems,&#8221; with the code shared publicly.

anti-competitive. And <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/08\/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe\/\">earlier this month<\/a> the U.K.&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) opened an investigation of the Privacy Sandbox proposal after complaints from a coalition of digital marketing companies and others from newspapers and technology companies alleging Google is abusing a dominant position by depreciating support for third-party trackers.<\/p>\n<p>On the privacy front, Google&#8217;s self-styled Privacy Sandbox isn&#8217;t exactly attracting effusive plaudits, either.<\/p>\n<p>T<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">he <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.eff.org\/deeplinks\/2019\/08\/dont-play-googles-privacy-sandbox-1\">Electronic Frontier Foundation<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> has, for example, dubbed FLoCs &#8220;the opposite of privacy-preserving technology&#8221; &#8212; warning in 2019 that the approach is akin to a &#8220;behavioral credit score&#8221;. It said then that the proposals risk sustaining discrimination against vulnerable groups of people, whose online activity would be pattern-matched with others without their say-so; and could also lead to leaking sensitive info about them to third parties &#8212; without offering web users any way to escape being put in an &#8220;interest based&#8221; ad targeting bucket.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>With objections piling up on sides of the aisle (advertiser versus user) &#8212; and now active regulatory scrutiny of the competition issue &#8212; Google has its work cut out to sell its preferred replacement for tracking cookies to all the relevant stakeholders. Though advertisers (and competition regulators) currently seem front of mind for the tech giant.<\/p>\n<p>In an <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/ads-commerce\/2021-01-privacy-sandbox\/?\">update about the Privacy Sandbox proposals<\/a> today, Google appears to be hoping to alleviate advertisers&#8217; concerns that the demise of tracking cookies will degrade their ability to lucratively target internet users &#8212; writing that tests of the FLoC technology suggest advertisers will continue to see &#8220;at least 95% of the conversions per dollar spent when compared to cookie-based advertising&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear how much test data was involved in Google generating that percentage, however. (We asked and Google did not have an immediate response.) So there&#8217;s zero meat on the bone of the &#8220;95% minimum&#8221; claim.<\/p>\n<p>Its spokesman did note that it will be opening up public testing in March &#8212; and expects advertisers to join in kicking FLoC&#8217;s tires then. So there&#8217;s clearly going to be more detail to come on this front.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Chrome intends to make FLoC-based cohorts available for public testing through origin trials with its next release in March and we expect to begin testing FLoC-based cohorts with advertisers in Google Ads in Q2,&#8221; writes Chetna Bindra, group product manager for user trust and privacy in the blog post, adding: &#8220;If you\u2019d like to get a head start, you can run your own simulations (as we did) based on the principles outlined in this <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/google\/ads-privacy\/blob\/master\/proposals\/FLoC\/FLOC-Whitepaper-Google.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-analytics-onclick=\"{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/github.com\/google\/ads-privacy\/blob\/master\/proposals\/FLoC\/FLOC-Whitepaper-Google.pdf&quot;}\">FLoC whitepaper<\/a>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s unsurprising that Google continues to emphasize the relative openness with which it&#8217;s developing the Privacy Sandbox proposals &#8212; as that may help it fight antitrust accusations. But it&#8217;s also noteworthy being as the adtech industry, which has been fighting to block\/delay its depreciation of third-party cookies, is busy spinning up its own contenders to replace trackers &#8212; and developing those competing proposals typically with a lot less transparency than Google.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"LHPGFn3xox\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/08\/22\/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web\/\">Google proposes new privacy and anti-fingerprinting controls for the web<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Google proposes new privacy and anti-fingerprinting controls for the web&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/08\/22\/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web\/embed\/#?secret=LHPGFn3xox\" data-secret=\"LHPGFn3xox\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Nonetheless, Google seems a whole lot more comfortable quantifying FLoC&#8217;s potential impact on ad revenue (tiny, per its latest claim) versus articulating what privacy gains internet users might expect from the proposed shift from individual tracking to run behavioral ads to being stuck in labelled buckets to run behavioral ads.<\/p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s blog post has a few fuzzy mentions &#8212; like &#8220;viable privacy-first alternatives&#8221; and &#8220;hiding individuals &#8216;in the crowd&#8217; \u201d &#8212; but there&#8217;s no metric or data offered on how much privacy users stand to gain if its preferred post-cookie future comes to pass.<\/p>\n<p>Test results it published in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adexchanger.com\/privacy\/google-releases-results-from-early-tests-of-cohort-based-advertising\/\">October<\/a> also focused on seeking to demonstrate to advertisers that FLoCs can deliver on other relevant ad metrics. Funnily enough, internet users&#8217; privacy &#8212; and what happens when <em>degrees<\/em> of privacy are lost &#8212; is rather harder for Google&#8217;s computer scientists to measure.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;advertisers can expect to see at least 95% of the conversions per dollar spent when compared to cookie-based advertising&quot;.

And to do so while still enabling opportunity and fair compensation for publishers and advertisers. So it&#8217;s really not even a matter of trying to approximate a kind of privacy: We&#8217;re trying to address a root critical concern of users, full stop,&#8221; he added.<\/p>\n<p>FLoCs are just one part of Google&#8217;s Privacy Sandbox proposals. The company is working on a slew of aligned efforts to simultaneously replace various other key components of the adtech ecosystem. And it gives an overview of some of these in the blog post &#8212; covering proposals for (post-cookie) conversation measurement; ad-fraud prevention; and anti-fingerprinting.<\/p>\n<p>Here it dwells briefly on retargeting\/remarketing &#8212; referring to a new Chrome proposal (called Fledge) that it says it&#8217;s considering for a &#8220;trusted server&#8221; model &#8220;specifically designed to store information about a campaign\u2019s bids and budgets&#8221;. This will also be made available for advertisers to test later this year, Google adds.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Over the last year, several members of the ad tech community have offered input for how this might work, including proposals from Criteo, NextRoll, Magnite and RTB House. Chrome has published a new proposal called <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/WICG\/turtledove\/blob\/master\/FLEDGE.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-analytics-onclick=\"{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/github.com\/WICG\/turtledove\/blob\/master\/FLEDGE.md&quot;}\">FLEDGE<\/a>\u00a0that expands on a previous Chrome proposal (called\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/WICG\/turtledove\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-analytics-onclick=\"{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/github.com\/WICG\/turtledove&quot;}\">TURTLEDOVE<\/a>) and takes into account the industry feedback they\u2019ve heard, including the idea of using a &#8220;trusted server&#8221; &#8212; as defined by compliance with certain principles and policies &#8212; that\u2019s specifically designed to store information about a campaign\u2019s bids and budgets. Chrome intends to make FLEDGE available for testing through origin trials later this year with the opportunity for ad tech companies to try using the API under a \u201cbring your own server\u201d model,&#8221; it writes.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Technology advancements such as FLoC, along with similar promising efforts in areas like measurement, fraud protection and anti-fingerprinting, are the future of web advertising \u2014 and the Privacy Sandbox will power our web products in a post-third-party cookie world,&#8221; it adds.<\/p>\n<p>Discussing Fledge&#8217;s potential, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lukOlejnik\">Dr Lukasz Olejnik<\/a>, an independent researcher and consultant, said there&#8217;s still a lot of uncertainty over how it might impact user privacy. &#8220;The Fledge experiment looks potentially interesting but it mixes in various proposals in this test. Such a mix would need to get a specific privacy assessment as the offered privacy qualities might be different than originally claimed. Furthermore, the current tests will have many privacy precautions intended for the future, turned off initially. It will be tricky to gradually turn them on,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"HayHAsFaW7\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/08\/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe\/\">Google&#8217;s plan to replace tracking cookies goes under UK antitrust probe<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Google&#8217;s plan to replace tracking cookies goes under UK antitrust probe&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/08\/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe\/embed\/#?secret=HayHAsFaW7\" data-secret=\"HayHAsFaW7\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As Google&#8217;s Privacy Sandbox remains under scrutiny over competition concerns, the tech giant has released an update claiming experimental ad-targeting techniques it&#8217;s developing as part of the plan to depreciate support for third-party cookies on its Chrome browser show results that are &#8220;nearly as effective as cookie-based approaches&#8221;.

partner is welcome to fill out the survey. (Please note, if you have filled the survey out already, there is no need to do it again).<\/p>\n<p>The shortlist of questions will require only brief responses, but the more you can add, the better.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/forms.gle\/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6\"><strong>You can fill out the survey here.<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Obviously, investors who contribute will be featured in the final surveys, with links to their companies and profiles.<\/p>\n<p>What kinds of things do we want to know?

What are you looking for in your next investment, in general? How is your local ecosystem going? And how has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy?<\/p>\n<p>This survey is part of a broader <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/extra-crunch\/investor-surveys\/\">series of surveys<\/a> we\u2019re doing to help founders find the right investors.<\/p>\n<p>For example, here is the recent <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/09\/14-vcs-discuss-covid-19-and-londons-future-as-a-tech-hub\/\">survey of London<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>You are not in Sweden, but would like to take part?

and SPAC raconteur Chamath Palihapitiya <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/chamath\/status\/1353674959789256705\">announced two new<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/chamath\/status\/1353673101901369345\">blank-check deals<\/a> involving Latch and Sunlight Financial.<\/p>\n<p>Latch, an enterprise SaaS company that makes keyless-entry systems, has raised $152 million in private capital, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/latch\/company_financials\">according to Crunchbase<\/a>. Sunlight Financial, which offers point-of-sale financing for residential solar systems, has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/sunlight-financial\/company_financials\">raised north of $700 million<\/a> in venture capital, private equity and debt.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re going to chat about the two transactions.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no escaping SPACs for a bit, so if you are tired of watching blind pools rip private companies into the public markets, you are not going to have a very good next few months. Why? There are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/when-spacs-attack-a-new-force-is-invading-wall-street-11611378007?mod=djemalertNEWS\">nearly 300 SPACs<\/a> in the market today looking for deals, and many will find one.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/subscribe\/?tpcc=theexchange\">every morning on Extra Crunch<\/a>, or get <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/newsletters\">The Exchange newsletter<\/a> every Saturday.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Think of SPACs are increasingly hungry sharks. As a shark get hungrier while the clock winds down on its deal-making window, it may get less choosy about what it eats (take public). There are enough SPACs on the hunt today that they would be noisy even if they were not time-constrained investment vehicles. But as their timers tick, expect their deal-making to get all the more creative.<\/p>\n<p>This brings us back to Chamath&#8217;s two deals. Are they more like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/12\/2021-a-spac-odyssey\/\">the Bakkt SPAC<\/a>, which led us to raise a few questions? Or more akin to the Talkspace SPAC, which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/23\/how-vcs-and-founders-see-2021-differently\/\">we found pretty reasonable?<\/a>\u00a0Let&#8217;s find out.<\/p>\n<h2>Keyless locks = Peloton for real estate<\/h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with the Latch deal.<\/p>\n<p>New York-based Latch sells &#8220;LatchOS,&#8221; a hardware and software system that works in buildings where access and amenities matter. Latch&#8217;s hardware works with doors, sensors and internet connectivity.<\/p>\n<p>The company has raised a number of private rounds, including a $126 million deal in August of 2019 that valued the company at $454.3 million on a post-money basis, <a href=\"http:\/\/pitchbook.com\">according to PitchBook<\/a> data. The company raised another $30 million in October of 2020, though its final private valuation is not known.<\/p>\n<p>As Chamath tweeted this morning, Latch is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.latch.com\/news\/latch-announces-planned-merger-with-tishman-speyer-sponsored-spac\">merging with TS Innovation Acquisitions Corp<\/a>, or $TSIA. The SPAC is associated with Tishman Speyer, a commercial real estate investor. You can see the synergies, as Latch&#8217;s products fit into the commercial real estate space.<\/p>\n<p>Up front, Latch is not a company that is only reporting future revenues. It has a history as an operating entity. Indeed, here&#8217;s its financial data per <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1826000\/000119312521015400\/d73403dex992.htm\">its investor presentation<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2100002\" style=\"width: 387px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2100002\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2100002 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-25-at-10.03.29-AM.png?w=377\" alt=\"\" width=\"377\" height=\"170\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-25-at-10.03.29-AM.png 377w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-25-at-10.03.29-AM.png?resize=150,68 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-25-at-10.03.29-AM.png?resize=300,135 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-25-at-10.03.29-AM.png?resize=50,23 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 377px) 100vw, 377px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2100002\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Latch<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Doing some quick match, Latch grew booked revenues 50.5% from 2019 to 2020. Its booked software revenues grew 37.1%, while its booked hardware top line expanded over 70% during the same period.<\/p>\n<p>That could be due to strong hardware installation fees, which could later result in software revenues; the company claims an average of a six-year software deal, so hardware revenues that are attached to new software incomes could low key declaim long-term SaaS revenues.<\/p>\n<p><em>Update: Adding some clarity here, the above are &#8220;booked&#8221; revenues, which I&#8217;ve made more clear, not actual revenues. Its net revenues, better known as actual revenues, were $18 million, with $14 million of that coming from hardware. So, today, the company is certainly more hardware-heavy than I first thought. Damn non-S-1 filings!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>While <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/loganbartlett\/status\/1353684437775638529\">some were quick to note<\/a> that the company is far from pure-SaaS &#8212; correct &#8212; I suspect that the model that could get some traction amongst investors is that this feels a bit like Peloton for real estate.

Founded by Tanya Van Court, who lost over $1 million in the 2001 bubble burst, the platform teaches financial literacy to children of all ages, helping them learn economic concepts, lingo and the principles of financial health.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>After long stints at Nickelodeon and ESPN, Van Court understands deeply how kids learn and what keeps their attention. She vowed to make sure that her children were never ignorant of what it takes to protect their wealth and create more.<\/p>\n<p>The app also allows parents to give allowances through the app, and even pay out their own specified amount for every quiz question the kid gets right in the app. Plus, family and friends can give &#8220;goal cards&#8221; instead of gift cards, helping kids save for the things they really want in the future.<\/p>\n<p>The company recently launched a debit card for kids, as well, letting parents control the way the card is used and even lock it until their kids have passed the week&#8217;s financial literacy quiz.<\/p>\n<p>Families save an average of $120 a month on the platform, and Van Court says that two families saved over $10,000 in the last year.<\/p>\n<p>The company is also launching a massive campaign next week for Black History Month with the goal of closing the wealth gap among Black children and kids of color\u00a0through financial education.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one thing to put a debit card into your teenager&#8217;s hands,&#8221; said Van Court. &#8220;That&#8217;s great. That teaches them how to spend money. It&#8217;s another thing to teach kids the core concepts about how to build wealth, or to know the difference between putting your money into an investment account, or putting your money into a CD versus a mutual fund versus a savings account. We teach what interest rates are, and what compound interest means. Our focus is on financial education because it&#8217;s not enough to teach kids how to spend.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Goalsetter raised $2.1 million in 2019 and now adds this latest round to that for a total of $6 million raised. This latest round was oversubscribed, giving Van Court the opportunity to be super selective about her investors.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Every single one of these investors has a demonstrated commitment prior to people marching in the streets in April, to social justice and to investing in diversity and inclusion initiatives and people,&#8221; said Van Court. &#8220;Every single one of them. That was really important because we were oversubscribed and we had the luxury of being able to pick who our investors were. Every one of the investors that we invited to our table were investors who we knew invited folks who look like us in 2019 and 2018 and 2017 to their table.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Nw2OUY4AH5\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/12\/goalsetter-gives-parents-a-way-to-teach-their-kids-how-to-save-money\/\">Goalsetter gives parents a way to teach their kids how to save money<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Goalsetter gives parents a way to teach their kids how to save money&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/12\/goalsetter-gives-parents-a-way-to-teach-their-kids-how-to-save-money\/embed\/#?secret=Nw2OUY4AH5\" data-secret=\"Nw2OUY4AH5\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Goalsetter, a platform that helps parents teach their kids financial literacy, announced the raise of a $3.9 million seed round this morning, led by Astia.

Club<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>As it faces an uncertain legal environment on some fronts, the company couldn&#8217;t be in a better position financially.<\/p>\n<p>The Pill Club, which is profitable and now has a $100 million run rate, is now ready for its closeup with Meyerdirk at the helm.<\/p>\n<p>The company has managed to make its mark in the crowded world of online prescriptions and refill fulfillment by focusing specifically on women&#8217;s health and ensuring that those services are available to as many potential patients as possible.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re now serving hundreds of thousands of women nationwide with 20% on Medicaid,&#8221; says Meyerdirk. &#8220;We prescribe in 43 states and the District of Columbia.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>For Meyerdirk, the background she had in logistics and fulfillment from her time at Uber Eats made the transition to the pill prescription and delivery service natural.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There is a heavy logistics element to it,&#8221; said Meyerdirk.<\/p>\n<p>As Meyerdirk takes the reins of the company, she said there&#8217;s a few areas that The Pill Club will expand into beyond its focus on birth control and contraception. &#8220;There are areas that our customers are asking for,&#8221; Meyerdirk said.<\/p>\n<p>These areas include, initially, dermatology. Last year the company launched a delivery service for contraceptives and women&#8217;s hygiene products like pads and tampons.<\/p>\n<p>As it continues to expand its product suite, it&#8217;s also growing its executive staff. The company not only added Meyerdirk, but also David Hsu as chief financial officer and Jeremy Downs as senior vice president of growth. Hsu joins the company from Honey, where he led the $4 billion acquisition negotiations with PayPal, and Downs comes from Uber Eats, where he spent five years leading growth.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We need sustained, long-term access to women\u2019s healthcare, not just a bridge while the pandemic persists; and we need coverage for essential health services like birth control and prenatal care, regardless of whether or not you\u2019re insured,&#8221; Meyerdirk wrote. &#8220;Reproductive care has and continues to be an essential part of our business, but there are countless opportunities to serve women in all of their life stages from puberty to menopause.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"YNQbXe9Qxt\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/07\/connecting-employer-healthcare-plans-to-surgical-centers-of-excellence-nets-carrum-health-40-million\/\">Connecting employer healthcare plans to surgical centers of excellence nets Carrum Health $40 million<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Connecting employer healthcare plans to surgical centers of excellence nets Carrum Health $40 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/07\/connecting-employer-healthcare-plans-to-surgical-centers-of-excellence-nets-carrum-health-40-million\/embed\/#?secret=YNQbXe9Qxt\" data-secret=\"YNQbXe9Qxt\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Liz Meyerdirk made a name for herself at Uber as the senior director and global head of business development for the company&#8217;s Uber Eats business and she&#8217;s now turning her attention to women&#8217;s health as the new chief executive of The Pill Club.

joining the exclusive club of small launch companies that have made it to orbit \u2014 the company just announced that it&#8217;s flying a payload on behalf of the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNAF). This is the first-ever satellite being put up by the Dutch Ministry of Defense, and it&#8217;s a small satellite that will act as a test platform for a number of different communications experiments.<\/p>\n<p>The satellite is called BRIK-II \u2014 not because it&#8217;s the second of its kind, but rather because it&#8217;s named after Brik, the first airplane ever owned and operated by the RNAF. This mission is one of Virgin Orbit&#8217;s first commercial operations after its successful test demonstration and will fly sometime later this year. It&#8217;s also being planned as a rideshare mission, with other payloads expected to join \u2014 likely from the U.S. Department of Defense, which is working with Virgin Orbit&#8217;s dedicated U.S. defense industry subsidiary VOX Space on planning what they&#8217;ll be adding to the mission load out.<\/p>\n<p>This upcoming mission is actually a key demonstration of a number of Virgin Orbit&#8217;s unique advantages in the launch market. For one, it&#8217;ll show how the U.S. DOD and its ally defense agencies can work together in the space domain when launching small communications satellites. Virgin Orbit is also going to use the mission as an opportunity to show off its &#8220;late-load integration&#8221; capabilities \u2014 effectively, how it can add a payload to its LauncherOne rocket just prior to launch.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>For this particular flight, there&#8217;s no real reason to do a late-load integration, since there&#8217;s plenty of lead time, but part of Virgin&#8217;s appeal is being able to nimbly add satellites to its rocket just before the carrier jet that flies it to its take-off altitude leaves the runway. Demonstrating that will go a long way to help illustrate how it differentiates its services from others in the launch market, such as Rocket Lab and SpaceX.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"k3ouJAzpya\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/18\/watch-virgin-orbit-launch-a-rocket-to-space-from-a-modified-747-for-the-first-time\/\">Watch Virgin Orbit launch a rocket to space from a modified 747 for the first time<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Watch Virgin Orbit launch a rocket to space from a modified 747 for the first time&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/18\/watch-virgin-orbit-launch-a-rocket-to-space-from-a-modified-747-for-the-first-time\/embed\/#?secret=k3ouJAzpya\" data-secret=\"k3ouJAzpya\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Virgin Orbit isn&#8217;t slowing down after joining the exclusive club of small launch companies that have made it to orbit \u2014 the company just announced that it&#8217;s flying a payload on behalf of the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNAF).

But he was inspired to return to entrepreneurship, he says, after experiencing a personal problem with trying to order shoes online.<\/p>\n<p>Realizing the opportunity for a &#8220;try before you buy&#8221; type of service, Ouyang first built BlackCart in 2017 as a business-to-consumer (B2C) platform that worked by way of a Chrome extension with some 50 different online merchants, largely in apparel.<\/p>\n<p>This <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Minimum_viable_product\">MVP<\/a> of sorts proved there was consumer demand for something like this in online shopping.<\/p>\n<p>Ouyang credits the earlier version of BlackCart with helping the team to understand what sort of products work best for this service.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think, in general, for try-before-you-buy, anything that&#8217;s moderate to higher price points, lower frequency of purchase, where the customer makes a considered purchase decision &#8212; those perform really well,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>Two years later, Ouyang took BlackCart to 500 Startups in San Francisco, where he then pivoted the business to the B2B offering it is today.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2100020\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2100020\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2100020\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/product3.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"329\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/product3.png 1189w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/product3.png?resize=150,73 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/product3.png?resize=300,145 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/product3.png?resize=768,372 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/product3.png?resize=680,329 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/product3.png?resize=50,24 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2100020\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> BlackCart<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The startup now provides a try-before-you-buy platform that integrates with online storefronts, including those from Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, Big Commerce, SalesForce Commerce Cloud, WordPress and even custom storefronts. The system is designed to be turnkey for online retailers and takes around 48 hours to set up on Shopify and around a week on Magento, for example.<\/p>\n<p>BlackCart has also developed its own proprietary technology around fraud detection, payments, returns and the overall user experience, which includes a button for retailers&#8217; websites.<\/p>\n<p>Because the online shoppers aren&#8217;t paying upfront for the merchandise they&#8217;re being shipped, BlackCart has to rely on an expanded array of behavioral signals and data in order to make a determination about whether the customer represents a fraud risk. As one example, if the customer had read a lot of helpdesk articles about fraud before placing their order, that could be flagged as a negative signal.<\/p>\n<p>BlackCart also verifies the user&#8217;s phone number at checkout and matches it to telco and government data sets to see if their historical addresses match their shipping and billing addresses.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2100021\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2100021\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2100021\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/product4.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"446\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/product4.png 896w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/product4.png?resize=150,98 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/product4.png?resize=300,197 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/product4.png?resize=768,504 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/product4.png?resize=680,446 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/product4.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2100021\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> BlackCart<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>After the customer receives the item, they are able to keep it for a period of time (as designated by the retailer) before being charged. BlackCart covers any fraud as part of its value proposition to retailers.<\/p>\n<p>BlackCart makes money by way of a rev share model, where it charges retailers a percentage of the sales where the customers have kept the products. This amount can vary based on a number of factors, like the fraud multiplier, average order value, the type of product and others. At the low end, it&#8217;s around 4% and around 10% on the high end, Ouyang says.<\/p>\n<p>The company has also expanded beyond home try-on to include try-before-you-buy for electronics, jewelry, home goods and more. It can even ship out makeup samples for home try-on, as another option.<\/p>\n<p>Once integrated on a website, BlackCart claims its merchants typically see conversion increases of 24%, average order values climb by 51% and bottom-line sales growth of 27%.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"tcbelA5qVK\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/22\/koio-the-d2c-luxury-sneaker-brand-raises-6-million\/\">Koio, the D2C luxury sneaker brand, raises $6 million<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Koio, the D2C luxury sneaker brand, raises $6 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/22\/koio-the-d2c-luxury-sneaker-brand-raises-6-million\/embed\/#?secret=tcbelA5qVK\" data-secret=\"tcbelA5qVK\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>To date, the platform has been adopted by more than 50 medium-to-large retailers, as well as e-commerce startups, like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/22\/koio-the-d2c-luxury-sneaker-brand-raises-6-million\/\">luxury sneaker brand Koio<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/11\/15\/diaco-gets-another-70m-from-sequoia-usv\/\">clothing startup Dia&amp;Co<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/08\/29\/helix-sleep-raises-7-4-million-to-sell-made-to-order-mattresses-online\/\">online mattress startup Helix Sleep<\/a> and<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/28\/caraway-seed-funding\/\"> cookware startup Caraway<\/a>, among others.

raises $110M on a $1.3B valuation to bring B2B payments for SMBs into the 21st century"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Payments for consumers have made a huge shift to the online world in the last year, a time when they have moved more of their purchasing to the internet to minimize in-person transactions in the midst of a virus-based health pandemic. Today, a startup that has built a similar kind of payments infrastructure &#8212; but specifically targeting small businesses and the payments they need to make &#8212; has raised a big round of funding to double down on its own slice of the market.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.meliopayments.com\/\">Melio<\/a>, which provides a platform for SMBs to pay other companies electronically using bank transfers, debit cards or credit &#8212; along with the option of cutting paper checks for recipients if that is what the recipients request &#8212; has closed $110 million in funding at a valuation that the company said was now $1.3 billion.<\/p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s focus to date has been building and growing a system to replace the paper invoices, snail mail and bank transfers that might take multiple days to clear and still dominate payments for small and medium enterprises. The company was founded in Israel but has to date focused a lot of its attention on the U.S. market, where it saw growth of 2,000% last year (it doesn&#8217;t disclose the actual number of customers that it has). CEO Matan Bar said that this is where the company will continue to focus for now.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>This latest round was led by Coatue and also included participation from previous backers Accel, Aleph, Bessemer Venture Partners, Corner Ventures, General Catalyst and Latitude. It caps off a huge year for the company, which raised $130 million in 2020 (and $256 million overall), with other recent backers including others like American Express and Salesforce.<\/p>\n<p>The latter two are strategic backers: AmEx is one of the options given to customers paying other businesses through Melio&#8217;s rails.<\/p>\n<p>Salesforce, meanwhile, is not yet an integration partner, but Bar &#8212; who co-founded the company with Ilan Atias and Ziv Paz (respectively CTO and COO) &#8212; described its interest as similar to that of Intuit-owned accounting giant QuickBooks. QuickBooks connects with Melio so that users of one can seamlessly import activity from one platform into the other, and Bar hinted that there is an interest from the CRM giant, which provides a number of other business and productivity tools, to work together in a similar fashion.<\/p>\n<p>Bar came to found Melio on the heels of years of experience in peer-to-peer payments focused on the consumer market. He previously ran PayPal&#8217;s business unit focused on peer-to-peer payments, which included Venmo in the U.S. and equivalent services (not branded Venmo) outside of it. He came to PayPal, which at the time was a part of eBay, through eBay&#8217;s acquisition of his previous startup, a social gifting platform called <a href=\"https:\/\/en.globes.co.il\/en\/article-1000681080\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Gifts Project<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As Bar describes it, PayPal &#8220;was the first time I experienced what the digitization of payments looked like as they were shifting from cash to mobile payments. Consumers were buying online instead of at brick-and-mortar stores, and even when they were getting physical items, they were paying online.&#8221; What he quickly realized, though, was that the same was not applying to the businesses themselves.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There are still trillions being transferred via paper checks in the B2B space,&#8221; he said, with paper invoices and paper checks dominating the market. &#8220;The space is way behind other payment areas. I would be talking with SMB owners who would be using fancy Square or PayPal point of sale devices, but when they had to pay, say, a coffee bean supplier, they stuffed checks in envelopes. That\u2019s very intriguing obviously, and it triggered our interest.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Interestingly this isn&#8217;t a problem that hasn&#8217;t been identified before, but many of the solutions, such as Bill.com or <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/06\/tipalti-receives-150m-at-a-2b-valuation-after-its-accounts-payable-platform-sees-a-surge-in-use\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tipalti<\/a>, are really designed for larger enterprises. &#8220;They are too overwhelming for SMBs,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Even their names say it all:\u00a0Accounts Payable Automation Solutions. It\u2019s about tens of thousands of payments, and accounting departments, not an order from a wine shop.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"1DPpdFuxIQ\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/06\/tipalti-receives-150m-at-a-2b-valuation-after-its-accounts-payable-platform-sees-a-surge-in-use\/\">Tipalti receives $150M at a $2B+ valuation after its accounts payable platform sees a surge in use<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Tipalti receives $150M at a $2B+ valuation after its accounts payable platform sees a surge in use&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/06\/tipalti-receives-150m-at-a-2b-valuation-after-its-accounts-payable-platform-sees-a-surge-in-use\/embed\/#?secret=1DPpdFuxIQ\" data-secret=\"1DPpdFuxIQ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>That formed the basis of what the startup started to build, which has been, in essence, a very pared-down version of these other payments platforms with SMB needs in mind.<\/p>\n<p>The first of these is a focus on cashflow, Bar said. Specifically, the Melio platform lets payments be made automatically but businesses themselves can delay the timing on when money actually leaves their accounts: &#8220;Buyers keep cash longer, vendors get paid faster,&#8221; is how Bar describes it.<\/p>\n<p>This is in part enabled by the tech that Melio has built, which builds in risk assessment, as well as fraud management, and balances payments across the whole of its platform to send money in and out without the need for the company to raise debt to back up those payments.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We leverage data to assess risk,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;Every dollar in this round is going towards R&amp;D and sales and marketing. We don\u2019t need the capital in our model.&#8221; It also works with the likes of AmEx and its own credit system in cases where people are paying on credit, but Bar also noted that currently most of the transactions that happen on its platform are not credit based. Most are bank transfers.<\/p>\n<p>While others like Stripe have also built B2B payment services to pay out suppliers, Bar points out that what it has created is unique in that it is a standalone service: no need to be a part of Stripe&#8217;s wider ecosystem of services to use this if you already use another payments provider you are happy with.<\/p>\n<p>Given that focus on cashflow for SMBs, what&#8217;s also interesting is the low bar to entry that Melio has built into its platform. Specifically, the service is completely free for businesses to use &#8212; that is, no fee is charged &#8212; as long as companies are making bank transfers or using debit cards. It takes a 2.9% fee when a business elects to use a credit card for a transaction (and even then Melio says that the fee is tax deductible in the U.S.).<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">He noted that one of the reasons that Melio has to date targeted the U.S. market is because of how antiquated it still is. &#8220;The average bank transfer still takes three to four business days, if you don\u2019t want to take any risk,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have developed models to do it same day. We take the risk that the buyer might not have the funds in that account but think about how that impacts cash flows. With Melio you still pay in three days, but money will be delivered the same day. That is how you can keep cash longer, without a payments risk.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Targeting a market that remains very underserved at a time when so much has gone virtual in payments is why investors are also interested.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMelio has identified both the opportunity and duty to help small businesses manage their finance remotely and improve cash flow, in normal times as well as during this crisis, as physical payments supply chains are interrupted and overwhelmed,&#8221; said\u00a0Michael Gilroy, a general partner at Coatue, in a statement. &#8220;Going digital is the only way small businesses can compete against larger rivals and stay ahead of the curve.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">In terms of more product development, Bar said that the company has\u00a0<\/span>received &#8220;a lot of incoming interest from partners to enable B2B payments within their products on their product,&#8221; similar to what QuickBooks is doing and Salesforce is likely to do. &#8220;Payments are contextual and they want to enable a quicker way to get there. The SMB is underserved. And yes, from a unit economics it\u2019s much better to go after Nike. But this is also to really create some financial inclusion. We want to enable services for the small shop that the big guys already have.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"DdbGOa6XZ5\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/21\/all-b2b-startups-are-in-the-payments-business\/\">All B2B startups are in the payments business<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;All B2B startups are in the payments business&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/21\/all-b2b-startups-are-in-the-payments-business\/embed\/#?secret=DdbGOa6XZ5\" data-secret=\"DdbGOa6XZ5\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Payments for consumers have made a huge shift to the online world in the last year, a time when they have moved more of their purchasing to the internet to minimize in-person transactions in the midst of a virus-based health pandemic.

the firm noted that 21 companies in its portfolio have raised more than $33 million in funding. This represents nearly four-fold growth over a year ago, when its portfolio raised $6 million (and just $3 million in 2018). The companies\u2019 combined valuation stands at more than $147 million, according to the firm.<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Founded by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ng.linkedin.com\/in\/yelebademosi\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yele Bademosi<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2017, Microtraction arrived on the continent&#8217;s early-stage investment scene with all intent to be &#8220;the most accessible and preferred source of pre-seed funding for African tech entrepreneurs.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bademosi, who returned to Nigeria from the U.K. in 2015, worked as the general manager for Starta Africa, an online community for African tech entrepreneurs. After his stint there, he saw the need to plug the gap of early-stage funding in Nigeria and the continent at large with Microtraction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Microtraction does not specify the size of its fund, but what is more clear is that\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it has attracted a great deal of attention and has built a strong network in part because of who backs it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mwseibel?lang=en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michael Seibel<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the CEO of Y Combinator, is a global advisor and an investor in the firm, and so is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/andyvolk\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Andy Volk<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the head of ecosystem for Google Sub-Saharan Africa.

With no on the ground knowledge as to which startups to fund but an interest to do so, for portfolio diversification and other personal reasons, Microtraction and a few other early-stage investors present the best bets to accomplish this goal.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"LQ4nYVVVNr\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/22\/how-fintech-and-serial-founders-drove-african-pre-seed-investing-to-new-heights-in-2020\/\">How fintech and serial founders drove African pre-seed investing to new heights in 2020<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;How fintech and serial founders drove African pre-seed investing to new heights in 2020&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/22\/how-fintech-and-serial-founders-drove-african-pre-seed-investing-to-new-heights-in-2020\/embed\/#?secret=LQ4nYVVVNr\" data-secret=\"LQ4nYVVVNr\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first, Microtraction&#8217;s standard deal was to offer portfolio startups $15,000 in exchange for a 7.5% equity.

We are always looking for companies that are solving huge problems that a lot of people face,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;Also, the tech and startup world moves fast, so we like teams who understand that and can show in real-time that they can execute. I believe that these global accelerators look for these same things.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typically, YC and other accelerators may perform extended due diligence and risk assessments before cutting cheques for any African startup without a local backer. Koleowo points out that this might be why Microtraction portfolio companies get accepted quicker. &#8220;The icing on the cake is that there is a level of de-risking that has been done by Microtraction and other local investors on the ground before these global accelerators step in,&#8221; he added.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"6rmr3n897s\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/19\/these-specialized-africa-vc-funds-are-welcoming-co-investors\/\">These specialized Africa VC funds are welcoming co-investors<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;These specialized Africa VC funds are welcoming co-investors&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/19\/these-specialized-africa-vc-funds-are-welcoming-co-investors\/embed\/#?secret=6rmr3n897s\" data-secret=\"6rmr3n897s\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, there&#8217;s no denying the significance of Microtraction&#8217;s advisory board in playing a part as to why half the firm&#8217;s portfolio are in global accelerators.

Also included in the first round are musician Shawn Mendes and &#8220;Orange Is the New Black&#8221; star Uzo Aduba.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2099964\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2099964\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2099964\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-draymond-green_01252021.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-draymond-green_01252021.jpg 3000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-draymond-green_01252021.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-draymond-green_01252021.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-draymond-green_01252021.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-draymond-green_01252021.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-draymond-green_01252021.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-draymond-green_01252021.jpg?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-draymond-green_01252021.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-draymond-green_01252021.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-draymond-green_01252021.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-draymond-green_01252021.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-draymond-green_01252021.jpg?resize=128,128 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2099964\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Apple<\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>There are five episodes up front, which will be available as activity cards on the Apple Watch Workout app. In fact, they should start showing as cards in the app&#8217;s feed shortly. Going forward, they\u2019ll be updated at a pace of one a week.<\/p>\n<p>The experience is straightforward on the face of it. Essentially, Apple asks guests to record themselves on a walk, telling stories and sharing three songs. Music is played through the app and images are delivered to the small screen in an effort to build a semi-immersive (but not distracting) accompaniment for your own walk. You can save the songs on an Apple Music playlist or save the episode for later, if you want to listen again. For those who utilize wheelchairs for mobility, the feature will appear as &#8220;Time to Push,&#8221; which builds on top of the wheelchair-based fitness tracking Apple introduced several years back.<\/p>\n<p>An Apple Fitness+ subscription is required to follow along. That&#8217;s due, in part, to a deeper integration with the premium fitness service. Both are also tied directly into other Apple services, like Music, which the company has made a kind of foundational element of its workouts.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve always been a big walker &#8212; trying to avoid driving or public transit when time and distance allow. But the past year has really prioritized the activity for me as both an excuse to leave my one-bedroom apartment and a way to get in a workout with all of the gyms closed for months on end. It is, frankly, a pretty big factor in keeping me going throughout the pandemic.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2099965\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2099965\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2099965\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg 3000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=128,128 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2099965\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Apple<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>When I walk, I do so with music or podcasts. I&#8217;ve tried some &#8220;walking meditations&#8221; in the past, but found that the experiences have revolved around notions of &#8220;quiet reflection,&#8221; which doesn&#8217;t quit do the trick when you&#8217;re walking over the 59th street bridge into midtown Manhattan. Time to Walk turns the idea on its head a bit, by approximating the experience of walking along with someone. As they walk, they relate a kind of stream-of-consciousness, relating often personal stories in the process. The idea, of course, being that walking is a head-clearing tool for many &#8212; creatives especially.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWalking is the most popular physical activity in the world, and one of the healthiest things we can do for our bodies. A walk can often be more than just exercise: It can help clear the mind, solve a problem, or welcome a new perspective,\u201d Apple&#8217;s Jay Blahnik <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/newsroom\/2021\/01\/time-to-walk-an-inspiring-audio-walking-experience-comes-to-apple-fitness-plus\/\">said in a release<\/a>. \u201cEven throughout this challenging period of time, one activity that has remained available to many is walking. With Time to Walk, we\u2019re bringing weekly original content to Apple Watch in Fitness+ that includes some of the most diverse, fascinating, and celebrated guests offering inspiration and entertainment to help our users keep moving through the power of walking.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Like Fitness+ before it, the new feature is well-timed, as many parts of the world (the U.S. in particular) are still very much in the throes of pandemic-fueled shutdowns. It seems there&#8217;s a new story every day about a new potential mutation warning us off the sorts of things we used to do. Time to Walk is an effort to give you some interesting company for those walks.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"EPEu1WDkA5\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/14\/fitness-wont-replace-the-gym-but-it-will-help-you-break-a-sweat\/\">It won\u2019t replace the gym, but Fitness+ will help you break a sweat<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;It won\u2019t replace the gym, but Fitness+ will help you break a sweat&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/14\/fitness-wont-replace-the-gym-but-it-will-help-you-break-a-sweat\/embed\/#?secret=EPEu1WDkA5\" data-secret=\"EPEu1WDkA5\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Here\u2019s a bit of a curve ball from Apple.

says it&#8217;s making variant-specific COVID-19 vaccines, but its existing vaccine should still work"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Moderna has detailed some of the steps it&#8217;s taking to ensure that its vaccine remains effective in the face of emerging strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that leads to COVID-19. These include testing how adding a second booster, for a total of three shots, works with its existing COVID-19 vaccine, and also developing a strain-specific variant designed to target spike proteins on the new variants of the virus that were first identified in the U.K. and in South Africa.<\/p>\n<p>The company is pursuing these measures &#8220;out of an abundance of caution,&#8221; the biotech firm said in <a href=\"https:\/\/investors.modernatx.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-retains-neutralizing-activity-against\">a press release<\/a>, since early studies show that the existing vaccine continues to prove effective against these new strains, albeit with some loss of efficacy specifically with the B.1.351 variant, which was first identified in patients in South Africa. Even so, it&#8217;s heartening to see the company moving quickly to address the virus&#8217; mutation, since it&#8217;s likely that similar adaptations will be required longer term to keep COVID-19 in control even once the current pandemic is ended.<\/p>\n<p>Further, Moderna says that in fact, it expects both its forthcoming candidate and its existing booster vaccine should be able to provide additional immunity-boosting capabilities when used in combination with &#8220;all of the leading vaccine candidates&#8221; on the market. That means the company believes it could be used in combination with the Oxford or Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccines to boost immunity, which could be helpful in cases where supplies of one or the other are low and there&#8217;s an urgent need to provide a booster in a timely manner.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The best news of all of this is, of course, that Moderna now has evidence that suggests the mRNA-based vaccine it&#8217;s already providing to people globally will still provide protection against SARS-CoV-2, and by extension, COVID-19. Specifically for the U.K. variant in particular, the study data shows no reduction in immune performance in patients who received the vaccine. As for the South African variant, that reduction in efficacy mostly translates to a potential of quicker waning of immunity provided by the jab &#8212; which hopefully just means people will need another jab sooner than expected, but shouldn&#8217;t lead to any dramatic changes in our combined global approach to providing inoculations, especially initially.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"yobzbqblBH\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/11\/moderna-is-developing-three-new-mrna-based-vaccines-for-seasonal-flu-hiv-and-nipah-virus\/\">Moderna is developing three new mRNA-based vaccines for seasonal flu, HIV and Nipah virus<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Moderna is developing three new mRNA-based vaccines for seasonal flu, HIV and Nipah virus&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/11\/moderna-is-developing-three-new-mrna-based-vaccines-for-seasonal-flu-hiv-and-nipah-virus\/embed\/#?secret=yobzbqblBH\" data-secret=\"yobzbqblBH\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Moderna has detailed some of the steps it&#8217;s taking to ensure that its vaccine remains effective in the face of emerging strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that leads to COVID-19.
